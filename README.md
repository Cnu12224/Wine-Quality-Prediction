# 🍷 Wine Quality Prediction – Machine Learning Project

This project predicts wine quality ratings based on various physicochemical properties using classification models. It uses the Wine Quality dataset to train and evaluate machine learning models for predicting quality labels.

## 🔍 Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Feature selection and scaling
- Model training using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM
- Evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

## 📚 Dataset
- Source: [UCI Machine Learning Repository – Wine Quality Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality)

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Cnu12224/Wine-Quality-Prediction.git
